# CS538-Project3
This repository is targeted at building a transport-layer multiplexing proxy, called TM 3 (Transparent Multi- pipe Multiplexing Middlebox), that enhances TCP performance. Multiplexing is a commonly used technique in computer networks: multiple data streams are combined into one single logical or physical channel, in order to share its expensive resource. For example, TCP connections between two end hosts are multiplexed into a single end-to-end IP path (so we need port numbers); new web protocols such as HTTP/2 multiplex many HTTP transactions into the same TCP connection to increase the bandwidth utilization; in DSL, voice and data are also multiplexed onto the same physical link.
